# Imdb
This repository contains simple yet efficient solution for sentiment polarity analysis of aclImdb dataset with TfIdfVectorizer and LinearSVC.

More details can be found on the original website of the dataset [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

The accuracy of this simple model is as high as 88.47%. 

Further work on preprocessing and n_grams, as well as complete switch to word embeddings and LSTM can bring even better results.
